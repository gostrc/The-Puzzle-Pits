About This Game
===============
This version of Puzzle Pits was completed in 1995.  By modern standards
the graphics and interface are obsolete, so we're currently working on a 
new, more modern version.  The game is still very playable, however, so 
we're releasing this for free distribution.  It's not shareware.  It's 
free.  If you do like it, though, be on the lookout for Puzzle Pits 1998.

Installation
============
If you're reading this then you've already unzipped PITS95.ZIP.  Good.
If you used PKUNZIP, be sure that the full directory structure was restored
(PKUNZIP -D PITS95).  All the .PIT files should be in a separate subdirectory 
of PITS95 called LEVELS.

Type PITS to start the game.


The Title Screen
================
Once the game has loaded you will see the Puzzle Pits Title Screen with 
three options.  Use the cursor keys to select your desired option and then 
press return.  The three options are:

1)  Enter Level Password
    Whenever you finish a level you receive a password that lets you skip
    that level in the future.  To skip past the most recent level you
    completed, choose this option and enter the password that was displayed
    at the end of that level.

2)  Start New Game
    Choose this option if you haven't played Puzzle Pits before.  You will
    begin on the first level.

3)  Quit
    This ends the game and returns you to DOS.


The Object Of The Game
======================
The game is set in a series of levels called Pits.  You must solve one level
before you can move on to the next.  A level is solved when you push things
to the correct place or stand in the correct place (it varies from level
to level - you'll see).  Sometimes timing and sequencing are just as
important as positioning.

There are four basic actions you can perform:  pushing objects, activating
items you find, walking, and waiting.

Pushing     The solutions to earlier levels involve pushing objects onto
            the correct location.  You can only push objects that are not
	    blocked by another object or wall.  You cannot pull objects.

Activating  Later levels introduce magical gems that you can pick up and
            activate.  Different colors of gems can affect different things.
	    Some work on you, some on objects, and others on the environment.
	    Exactly what these gems do and how to use them is part of the
	    puzzle.

Walking     In later levels, exactly where you stand takes on increasing
            importance.  You might want to stand on top of a pressure plate
	    to cause a wall to disappear or avoid walking on a certain stone
	    tile that will sink into water.  You will also come across
	    signs and switches that you can walk into to read or activate.

Waiting     Nothing happens in Puzzle Pits until you take an action.  Usually
            this action will be walking from one place to another, but 
	    sometimes you will just want to stand still and let things happen
	    around you.
